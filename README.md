this is the start of my git project to help colloboration on my dissertaiton code

to do list 

config file to set paths but to be reachable whether i run full code or just one processing step at a time
call the config file in each processing step if necessary

adjust processonesample become 2 fxns "processCDF" and processarray" to more readily adjust if there are missing files and then make a processonesample that runs both if i am starting from scratch.

still need to look into xarray to see if i can "processonesample" and "processonecase" without saving crazy amounts of . nc files
