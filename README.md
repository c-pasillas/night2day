- need to hae a code to rebuild the larger array ( for each time step) from the patches since flatten will not work to maintain spatial and temporal considerations.  This way I can have single image of the area for test cases.  Later I would be running the learned model on different data set and can hopefully reprocess image by time and area as well.
